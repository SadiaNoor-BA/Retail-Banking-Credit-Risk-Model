##Project 1: Retail Banking Credit Risk & Sensitivity Model
Executive Summary I developed an end-to-end Credit Risk and Sensitivity Analysis model to automate the loan approval process and simulate interest revenue under varying market conditions. Using a data-driven approach, I transformed a raw loan portfolio into a dynamic dashboard that balances institutional risk with revenue growth.

##Technical Contribution
•	Automated Decision Engine: I engineered a logic-based system that automatically classifies applicants as APPROVE or REJECT based on a minimum 600 Credit Score and a maximum 40% Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio.
•	Portfolio Management: My model successfully processed a total capital volume of $315K, achieving a controlled 75.00% Approval Rate.
•	Predictive Sensitivity Analysis: I built a custom "What-If" simulation tool that allows stakeholders to adjust market rate hikes in real-time.
•	Financial Impact: At a simulated 0.02 rate hike, the model forecasts a projected revenue increase from the $7.15K baseline to $10.45K in stressed interest.

##Business Value
This project provides the bank with dual-layer visibility: it automates the operational burden of credit screening while providing a strategic "guardrail" to protect interest margins during economic volatility.
